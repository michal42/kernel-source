Subject: KVM: nVMX: Replace kvm_set_cr0 with vmx_set_cr0 in
	load_vmcs12_host_state
Git-repo: git://kernel.suse.com/kernel.git
Git-commit: 9e3e4dbf4469ba19971fbd547f1be713604c7f5e
Patch-mainline: v3.13-rc1
References: bcn#871306

kvm_set_cr0 performs checks on the state transition that may prevent
loading L1's cr0. For now we rely on the hardware to catch invalid
states loaded by L1 into its VMCS. Still, consistency checks on the host
state part of the VMCS on guest entry will have to be improved later on.
