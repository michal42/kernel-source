Subject: [PATCH] locking/mutex: Fix debug checks

References: VM Performance
Patch-mainline: v3.15
Git-commit: 6f008e72cd111a119b5d8de8c5438d892aae99eb

OK, so commit:

  1d8fe7dc8078 ("locking/mutexes: Unlock the mutex without the wait_lock")

generates this boot warning when CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES=y:

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 139 at /usr/src/linux-2.6/kernel/locking/mutex-debug.c:82 debug_mutex_unlock+0x155/0x180() DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(lock->owner != current)

And that makes sense, because as soon as we release the lock a
new owner can come in...

One would think that !__mutex_slowpath_needs_to_unlock()
implementations suffer the same, but for DEBUG we fall back to
mutex-null.h which has an unconditional 1 for that.

The mutex debug code requires the mutex to be unlocked after
doing the debug checks, otherwise it can find inconsistent
state.
