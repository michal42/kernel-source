Subject: [PATCH] sched,numa: rework best node setting in task_numa_migrate

References: Automatic NUMA Balancing (fate#315482)
Patch-mainline: No, expected 3.17

Fix up the best node setting in task_numa_migrate to deal with a task
in a pseudo-interleaved NUMA group, which is already running in the
best location.

Set the task's preferred nid to the current nid, so task migration is
not retried at a high rate.
