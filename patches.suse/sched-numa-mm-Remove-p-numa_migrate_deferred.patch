Subject: [PATCH] sched/numa, mm: Remove p->numa_migrate_deferred

References: Automatic NUMA Balancing (fate#315482)
Patch-mainline: v3.15
Git-commit: 52bf84aa206cd2c2516dfa3e03b578edf8a3242f

Excessive migration of pages can hurt the performance of workloads
that span multiple NUMA nodes.  However, it turns out that the
p->numa_migrate_deferred knob is a really big hammer, which does
reduce migration rates, but does not actually help performance.

Now that the second stage of the automatic numa balancing code
has stabilized, it is time to replace the simplistic migration
deferral code with something smarter.
