Subject: [PATCH] sched,numa: add cond_resched to task_numa_work

References: Automatic NUMA Balancing (fate#315482)
Patch-mainline: v3.14
Git-commit: 3cf1962cdbf6b3a9e3ef21116d215bbab350ea37

Normally task_numa_work scans over a fairly small amount of memory,
but it is possible to run into a large unpopulated part of virtual
memory, with no pages mapped. In that case, task_numa_work can run
for a while, and it may make sense to reschedule as required.
