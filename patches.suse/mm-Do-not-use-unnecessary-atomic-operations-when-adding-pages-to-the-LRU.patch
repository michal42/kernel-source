Subject: [PATCH] mm: Do not use unnecessary atomic operations when adding
 pages to the LRU

References: VM/FS Performance
Patch-mainline: v3.16
Git-commit: 6fb81a17d21f2a138b8f424af4cf379f2b694060

When adding pages to the LRU we clear the active bit unconditionally. As the
page could be reachable from other paths we cannot use unlocked operations
without risk of corruption such as a parallel mark_page_accessed. This
patch test if is necessary to clear the atomic flag before using an atomic
operation. In the unlikely even this races with mark_page_accesssed the
consequences are simply that the page may be promoted to the active list
that might have been left on the inactive list before the patch. This is
a marginal consequence.
