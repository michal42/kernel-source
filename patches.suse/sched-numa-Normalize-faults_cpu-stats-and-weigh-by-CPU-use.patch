Subject: [PATCH] sched/numa: Normalize faults_cpu stats and weigh by CPU use

References: Automatic NUMA Balancing (fate#315482)
Patch-mainline: v3.15
Git-commit: 7e2703e6099609adc93679c4d45cd6247f565971

Tracing the code that decides the active nodes has made it abundantly clear
that the naive implementation of the faults_from code has issues.

Specifically, the garbage collector in some workloads will access orders
of magnitudes more memory than the threads that do all the active work.
This resulted in the node with the garbage collector being marked the only
active node in the group.

This issue is avoided if we weigh the statistics by CPU use of each task in
the numa group, instead of by how many faults each thread has occurred.

To achieve this, we normalize the number of faults to the fraction of faults
that occurred on each node, and then multiply that fraction by the fraction
of CPU time the task has used since the last time task_numa_placement was
invoked.

This way the nodes in the active node mask will be the ones where the tasks
from the numa group are most actively running, and the influence of eg. the
garbage collector and other do-little threads is properly minimized.

On a 4 node system, using CPU use statistics calculated over a longer interval
results in about 1% fewer page migrations with two 32-warehouse specjbb runs
on a 4 node system, and about 5% fewer page migrations, as well as 1% better
throughput, with two 8-warehouse specjbb runs, as compared with the shorter
term statistics kept by the scheduler.
