Subject: [PATCH] sched: Fix exec_start/task_hot on migrated tasks

References: Scheduler scalability
Patch-mainline: v3.16-rc1
Git-commit: 3944a9274ef6cda0cc282daf0739832f661670f7

task_hot checks exec_start on any runnable task, but if it has been
migrated since the it last ran, then exec_start is a clock_task from
another cpu. If the old cpu's clock_task was sufficiently far ahead of
this cpu's then the task will not be considered for another migration
until it has run. Instead reset exec_start whenever a task is migrated,
since it is presumably no longer hot anyway.
