Subject: [PATCH] sched/numa: Slow scan rate if no NUMA hinting faults are
 being recorded

References: Automatic NUMA Balancing (fate#315482)
Patch-mainline: v3.13-rc1
Git-commit: f307cd1a32fab53012b01749a1f5ba10b0a7243f

NUMA PTE scanning slows if a NUMA hinting fault was trapped and no page
was migrated. For long-lived but idle processes there may be no faults
but the scan rate will be high and just waste CPU. This patch will slow
the scan rate for processes that are not trapping faults.
