Subject: [PATCH] Revert "mm: sched: numa: Delay PTE scanning until a task is
 scheduled on a new node"

References: Automatic NUMA Balancing (fate#315482)
Patch-mainline: v3.13-rc1
Git-commit: b726b7dfb400c937546fa91cf8523dcb1aa2fc6e

PTE scanning and NUMA hinting fault handling is expensive so commit
5bca2303 ("mm: sched: numa: Delay PTE scanning until a task is scheduled
on a new node") deferred the PTE scan until a task had been scheduled on
another node. The problem is that in the purely shared memory case that
this may never happen and no NUMA hinting fault information will be
captured. We are not ruling out the possibility that something better
can be done here but for now, this patch needs to be reverted and depend
entirely on the scan_delay to avoid punishing short-lived processes.
