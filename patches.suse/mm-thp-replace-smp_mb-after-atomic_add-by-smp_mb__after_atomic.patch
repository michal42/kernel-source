Subject: [PATCH] mm, thp: replace smp_mb after atomic_add by
 smp_mb__after_atomic

References: VM Performance
Patch-mainline: v3.17-rc1
Git-commit: 3a79d52aa3c63c939f5a1f86e80e634f84e987c4

In some architectures like x86, atomic_add() is a full memory barrier.
In that case, an additional smp_mb() is just a waste of time.  This
patch replaces that smp_mb() by smp_mb__after_atomic() which will avoid
the redundant memory barrier in some architectures.

With a 3.16-rc1 based kernel, this patch reduced the execution time of
breaking 1000 transparent huge pages from 38,245us to 30,964us.  A
reduction of 19% which is quite sizeable.  It also reduces the %cpu time
of the __split_huge_page_refcount function in the perf profile from
2.18% to 1.15%.
