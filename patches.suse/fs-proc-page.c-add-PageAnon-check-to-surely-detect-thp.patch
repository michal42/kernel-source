Subject: [PATCH] fs/proc/page.c: add PageAnon check to surely detect thp

References: VM functionality
Patch-mainline: v3.14
Git-commit: e3bba3c3c90cd434c1ccb9e5dc704a96baf9541c

stable_page_flags() checks !PageHuge && PageTransCompound && PageLRU to
know that a specified page is thp or not.  But sometimes it's not enough
and we fail to detect thp when the thp is on pagevec.  This happens only
for a few seconds after LRU list operations, but it makes it difficult
to control our applications depending on this flag.

So this patch adds another check PageAnon to detect thps on pagevec.  It
might not give the future extensibility for thp pagecache, but it's OK
at least for now.
