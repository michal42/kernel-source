Subject: [PATCH 4/4] printk: allow increasing the ring buffer depending on the
 number of CPUs
Patch-mainline: v3.17-rc1
Git-commit: 23b2899f7f194f06e09b52a1f46f027a21fae17c
References: bnc#835888

In addition, there are applied some changes that fix the build and clean
up the documentation. See https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/6/26/177.


The default size of the ring buffer is too small for machines with a large
amount of CPUs under heavy load.  What ends up happening when debugging is
the ring buffer overlaps and chews up old messages making debugging
impossible unless the size is passed as a kernel parameter.  An idle
system upon boot up will on average spew out only about one or two extra
lines but where this really matters is on heavy load and that will vary
widely depending on the system and environment.

There are mechanisms to help increase the kernel ring buffer for tracing
through debugfs, and those interfaces even allow growing the kernel ring
buffer per CPU.  We also have a static value which can be passed upon
boot.  Relying on debugfs however is not ideal for production, and relying
on the value passed upon bootup is can only used *after* an issue has
creeped up.  Instead of being reactive this adds a proactive measure which
lets you scale the amount of contributions you'd expect to the kernel ring
buffer under load by each CPU in the worst case scenario.

We use num_possible_cpus() to avoid complexities which could be introduced
by dynamically changing the ring buffer size at run time,
num_possible_cpus() lets us use the upper limit on possible number of CPUs
therefore avoiding having to deal with hotplugging CPUs on and off.  This
introduces the kernel configuration option LOG_CPU_MAX_BUF_SHIFT which is
used to specify the maximum amount of contributions to the kernel ring
buffer in the worst case before the kernel ring buffer flips over, the
size is specified as a power of 2.  The total amount of contributions made
by each CPU must be greater than half of the default kernel ring buffer
size (1 << LOG_BUF_SHIFT bytes) in order to trigger an increase upon
bootup.  The kernel ring buffer is increased to the next power of two that
would fit the required minimum kernel ring buffer size plus the additional
CPU contribution.  For example if LOG_BUF_SHIFT is 18 (256 KB) you'd
require at least 128 KB contributions by other CPUs in order to trigger an
increase of the kernel ring buffer.  With a LOG_CPU_BUF_SHIFT of 12 (4 KB)
you'd require at least anything over > 64 possible CPUs to trigger an
increase.  If you had 128 possible CPUs the amount of minimum required
kernel ring buffer bumps to:

   ((1 << 18) + ((128 - 1) * (1 << 12))) / 1024 = 764 KB

Since we require the ring buffer to be a power of two the new required
size would be 1024 KB.

This CPU contributions are ignored when the "log_buf_len" kernel parameter
is used as it forces the exact size of the ring buffer to an expected
power of two value.

+	  This option allows to increase the default ring buffer size

+	  lines however it might be much more when problems are reported,
+	  e.g. backtraces.
+
+	  The increased size means that a new buffer has to be allocated and
+	  the original static one is unused. It makes sense only on systems
+	  with more CPUs. Therefore this value is used only when the sum of
+	  contributions is greater than the half of the default kernel ring
+	  buffer as defined by LOG_BUF_SHIFT. The default values are set
+	  so that more than 64 CPUs are needed to trigger the allocation.
+
+	  Also this option is ignored when "log_buf_len" kernel parameter is
+	  used as it forces an exact (power of two) size of the ring buffer.
+
+	  The number of possible CPUs is used for this computation ignoring
+	  hotplugging making the compuation optimal for the the worst case
+	  scenerio while allowing a simple algorithm to be used from bootup.
