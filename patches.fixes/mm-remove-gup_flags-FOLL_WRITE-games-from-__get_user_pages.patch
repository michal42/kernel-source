Subject: mm: remove gup_flags FOLL_WRITE games from __get_user_pages()
Patch-mainline: not yet, EMBARGO until 20.10.2016
References: bnc1004418, CVE-2016-5195

This is an ancient bug that was actually attrempted to be fixed once
(badly) by me eleven years ago in commit 4ceb5db9757a ("Fix
get_user_pages() race for write access") but that was then undone due to
problems on s390 by commit f33ea7f404e5 ("fix get_user_pages bug").

In the meantime, the s390 situation has long been fixed, and we can once
more try to fix it by checking the pte_dirty() bit properly (and do it
better).  Also, the VM has become more scalable, and what was a purely
theoretical race back then has become easier to trigger.

To fix it, we introduce a new internal FOLL_COW flag to mark the "yes,
we already did a COW" rather than play racy games with FOLL_WRITE that
is very fundamental, and then use the pte dirty flag to validate that
the FOLL_COW flag is still valid.
