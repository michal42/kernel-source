Subject: [PATCH 2/6] ocfs2: Move dquot_initialize() in ocfs2_delete_inode()
 somewhat later
Patch-mainline: v3.15-rc1
References: fate#315054
Git-commit: bd62ad7aebd8e8895bb7649ace948040332f27d3

Move dquot_initalize() call in ocfs2_delete_inode() after the moment we
verify inode is actually a sane one to delete. We certainly don't want
to initialize quota for system inodes etc. This also avoids calling into
quota code from downconvert thread.

Add more details into the comment why bailing out from
ocfs2_delete_inode() when we are in downconvert thread is OK.
