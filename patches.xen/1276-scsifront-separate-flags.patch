Patch-mainline: Never, SUSE-Xen specific
Subject: scsifront: don't use bitfields for indicators modified under different locks

It is no good idea to have bitfields in the same byte which are modified
with different locks held (or, in this case, one with lock and one
without). Use at least bytes for this purpose.
